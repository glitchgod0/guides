* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smallblue.png "Tan Square") **Depending on your computer**: 
	* **Change `RSX FIFO Accuracy`** to `Fast` - May help with latency but needs more testing. **If you use `Fast`, you must set a `Driver Wake-up Delay` to `20µs` or higher!**
	* **Set `Driver Wake-up Delay` to `20µs`** to avoid crashing after a few songs if using `Fast` RSX FIFO Accuracy. Increase it to `40µs` if the issue persists.  
	If it keeps happening, keep increasing it by increments of 20.

* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **Strongly Suggested**: 
	* **Enable `Debug Console Mode`** - This, along with Rock Band 3 Deluxe, will allow Rock Band 3 to have more memory. This means more songs (up to 16000) and increased stability.  
	**Everyone should enable this!** [[Click here for more information.]](../advanced/memory//)
	* **Change `Exclusive Fullscreen Mode` to `Prefer borderless fullscreen`** to prevent potential crashes and audio desync when changing from Rock Band 3 to another program while in fullscreen.
	* **Toggle `Use Re-BAR memory for GPU uploads` depending on your graphics card**. This can increase performance significantly if you have a Re-BAR compatible graphics card and Re-BAR is enabled in your BIOS. Check your graphics card and BIOS manuals for more information!
