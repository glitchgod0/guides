* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smallblue.png "Blue Square") **Tweak depending on computer**:
	* Leave `Enable Buffering` on if you prefer stable audio at the cost of latency.  
	Disable it if you want less latency at the cost of potential audio errors.
	* **Adjust `Audio Buffer Duration`** depending on system. This only works if `Enable Buffering` is on!
		* Set this as low as you can before you hear crackling. `32 ms` is a decent starting point on most systems.
			* Lower values = less audio latency but more CPU impact.
			* Higher values =  more audio latency but use less CPU impact.
		* Vocalists are affected the most by this, as a higher latency creates a distracting echo. Instrument players can use calibration to compensate regardless of audio buffer setting.
		* You can change this while the game is running!
		* **Changing this require re-calibrating in Rock Band 3's system settings**.
	* **Change `Audio Out` to `XAudio2`** - While **most users should stay on `Cubeb`**, a few people have experienced better performance with XAudio2. Your milage may vary.

* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **Change depending on audio setup**: 
	* **For vocalists:**
		* **Set `Microphone Type` to `Standard`**.
		* **Select an input device in `Mic1`, `Mic2`, and `Mic3`** for vocals.  
		If not playing vocals, `Mic1` will be used for voice chat.
	* **Change `Audio Device`** if you want audio to come out of another device that isn't the default one.
	* Change `Audio Output Format` if you're using a surround sound setup.  
	Rock Band 3 supports LPCM 2.0, LPCM 5.1, and Dolby Digital 5.1 **(NOT RECOMMENDED!)**.
