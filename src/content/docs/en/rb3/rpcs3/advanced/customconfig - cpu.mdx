* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smallblue.png "Blue Square") **Improved performance, depending on machine**: 
	* **Change `SPU Block Size` to `Mega`** - Ties smaller SPU compiled together, which can help machines with fewer cores/threads.  
	Drastically speeds up game startup time on certain machines.
	* **Change `Preferred SPU Threads` to `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`** - May help prevent stutter caused by CPU overloads on systems with fewer cores/threads.  
	**Start at `4` and lower it one by one until it improves**.
	* **Change `Thread Scheduler` to `RPCS3 Scheduler`, or `RPCS3 Alternative Scheduler`** - **FOR CPUs WITH 12+ THREADS ONLY!**  
	May help with thread distribution to prevent microstutters.
