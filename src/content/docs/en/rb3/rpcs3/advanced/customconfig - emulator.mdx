You can leave this as is if you want, but these are still nice options to consider:
* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **Optional tweaks**: 
	* **`Show trophy popups`** - Mimics the way Trophy notifications appear on the PS3.
	* **`Show RPCN popups`** - Shows a message on the top left whenever you or your friends connect to RPCN.
	* **`Show shader compilation hint`** - This creates a popup whenever RPCS3 is compiling shaders. When you emulate PS3 games, it has to compile shaders to "translate" the graphics from a PS3 format to a format your PC can work with. **The game will stutter when this happens. This happens on ALL computer systems. When it finishes** compiling an effect, **it will usually never happen again**. **The best way to deal with this is** just **to play the game** as it will quickly go away.  
	You can also use Rock Band 3 Deluxe's Autoplay modifier to let it go through a few songs in party shuffle and let it compile a decent amount of shaders.
	* **`Show PPU compilation hint`** - This creates a popup whenever RPCS3 is compiling units for the PPU. This only comes up when launching the game if you're using suggested settings.
	* **`Show mouse and keyboard toggle hint`** - Shows a message on the top left whenever the keyboard is being used in the native interface, such as the virtual keyboard that comes up when naming things.
	* **`Show capture hints`** - Shows a notification when you take a screenshot.
	* **`Start games in Fullscreen mode`** - Switches to Fullscreen when you start Rock Band 3.
	* **`Use Native Interface`** - If you disable this, it will remove the pretty displays RPCS3 adds, including notifications, RPCN menus, and the game startup background. It will instead use old school pop-ups. This can sometimes fix a problem with instrument controllers soft-locking the game when the keyboard comes up.
