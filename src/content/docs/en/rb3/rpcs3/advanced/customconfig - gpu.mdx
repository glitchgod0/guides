* ![A green square with a dashed outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smallgreen.png "Green Square") **REQUIRED**: 
	* **Enable `Write Color Buffers`** - Characters will have severe graphical bugs without this.

* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](/assets/rb3pc/config/smallblue.png "Blue Square") **Adjust depending on graphics card**: 
	* **Adjust `Resolution Scale`** to increase the rendering resolution. Higher numbers require a better graphics card.  
	Lowering this below 100% will rarely help performance.
	* **Adjust `Output Scaling`** to preference and to what your computer can handle. This affects how the game is "blown up" in size when fitting to your monitor's native resolution. Helpful for those keeping `Resolution Scale` (mentioned above) at 100% while playing on a monitor larger than 1280x720.
		* `Nearest` is completely unfiltered and gives you a raw unmodified image. This can cause the game to look pixelated.
		* `Bilinear` uses smoothing to scale the image up. This may cause the game to look blurry.
		* `FidelityFX Super Resolution 1` (FSR1) uses complicated math to sharpen and enhance the image when it gets blown up to your monitor's resolution. This can create odd artifacts in some instances.
			* You can use `RCAS Sharpening Strength` below to adjust the strength of its effect.
	* **Change `Framelimit`**
		* Leave it on `Auto` to let RPCS3 set a frame rate limit.
		* Set it to `Off` **if you're using `VSync` or an external frame limiting**.
		* `120` is recommended if you're using a 144Hz (or higher) display.
		* Set it to `Display` if you want to lock to your display's refresh rate.
		* **DO NOT** set it below `60`!
		* Higher framerates require more resources. Keep this in mind if you're on a low end system.
		* It's suggested to disable VSync within Rock Band 3 Deluxe itself in `Menu > Options > Deluxe Settings > Venue Options > Graphics > Advanced`.
	* **Enable `VSync`** - Reduces screen tearing at the cost of slight latency. It's suggested to use your graphics card's VSync instead.  
	**Do not enable `VSync` with `Framelimit` enabled**.
	* **Adjust `Anisotropic Filter`** - Improves texture rendering at distances and angles. Just about every GPU should be able to handle `x16`.
	* **Change `ZCULL Accuracy` to `Relaxed`** - Provides a slight performance improvement at the cost of some accessories looking weird at distances.
	* **Adjust `Shader Quality`** to preference - Setting this to `Low` seems to do nothing visually but it improves performance.
	* **Enable `Multithreaded RSX`** if you have a computer with CPU cores/threads to spare.  
	This offloads a few RSX (graphics unit in the PS3) operations to other cores/threads.
	* **Enable `Asynchronous Texture Streaming`** if you have a high end machine, are using Vulkan, and also enabled `Multithreaded RSX`.  
	This transfers textures on a parallel thread, which may help performance.
	* Change `Renderer` depending on your computer. - This is at the very bottom because **it's not recommended for most people**.  
	Only people on extremely low end machines should change this to `OpenGL`.
