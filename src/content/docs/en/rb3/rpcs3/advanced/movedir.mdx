If Rock Band 3's files are taking up too much space on your main drive, you can move them to a different drive while keeping RPCS3 itself on your main drive.  
Make sure RPCS3 is closed before starting this.
<Steps>
1. First, create a folder where all of this stuff will be moved to.  
The folder will be named `RPCS3 Directory` in this tutorial.
	> <Image src={dirfolder} alt="A folder named 'RPCS3 Directory'." />

2. Back in the folder RPCS3 is in, cut the following folders:
	* `dev_bdvd`
	* `dev_flash`
	* `dev_flash2`
	* `dev_flash3`
	* `dev_hdd0`
	* `dev_hdd1`
	* `dev_usb000`
	* `games`
	> <Image src={dircut} alt="The folders listed being cut." />

3. Paste them into the folder you created.
	<Image src={dirpaste} alt="The folders that were cut being pasted into the 'RPCS3 Directory' folder." />

4. When it finishes pasting, reopen RPCS3 then click on `Manage > Virtual File System`
	<Image src={dirrpcs3} alt="RPCS3 with the user hovering over 'Virtual File System', under the 'Manage' category." />

5. In the `Virtual File System` window, click on the `+` symbol near the bottom right.
	> <Image src={dirvfsadd} alt="RPCS3's Virtual File System Menu showing the cursor hovering over the plus symbol at the bottom." />

6. Go to the folder you created, click on it, and then click on `Select Folder`.
	> <Image src={dirfoldersel} alt="RPCS3's 'Choose a directory' window, selecting the created folder." />

7. Finally, enable the new folder with the checkmark then click `Save`.
	> <Image src={dirvfssave} alt="RPCS3's 'Choose a directory' window selecting the created folder." />
</Steps>
That's it! RPCS3 will now use this folder.
